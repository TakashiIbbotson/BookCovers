# Book Covers

On beginning this task the first thing I did was look through the books I had at home to get an idea of what type of books I would be interested in designing.  The first book I saw that I was interested in was called 'Missing Judy' by Anne Cassidy. I'd read this book a few times and I enjoyed the story.  The story involved a child who had been missing for 8 years when new leads begin to show and so the case is reopened.  I researched the book to find any book covers created for the book.

I began to think about the main points in the book and the most memorable part for me was the memory the protagonist has of the last memory of his sister with a red balloon.  I'd already seen that this was on some of the book covers however I wanted to create my own take on it.  I created a silhoutte image of a young child and added a balloon into the image of which I changed the layer style in order to give it a translucent look.  This semi-realism juxtaposed with the harsh black silhouette.

After creating this book cover I realised I couldn't think of any books of the same genre or the same author so after I created this I began to think of other books I liked.  As one of my favourite series of books is Harry Potter I decided to select a few of the books to design for.  I decided to keep the flat silhouette style design that I had used for Missing Judy.  I began to research the Harry Potter books to see the covers.

I began to think of which books I would choose and in the end I decided on The Philosopher's Stone, The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire.  I wasn't sure what I would put on each cover.  

For The Philsopher's Stone I decided to use a chess piece.  Wizard's Chess plays a large part within the books.  Not only is Harry introduced to it within the book and plays it throughout his school year with Ron Weasley but he also has to play a lifesize version of Wizard Cheese in which he takes the place of the Bishop in order to get to the Philsopher's Stone.  I originally planned to choose a Bishop for the front cover however I didn't like the way it looked so instead I chose the King.  I chose a piece and used the Threshold tool within Photoshop to create a silhouette effect.

I chose a full moon for the Prisoner of Azkaban to represent Proffesor Lupin's ailment to the moon.  As he was a Werewolf and this held a lot of value within the book and was the reason he stopped teaching at the post of Defense Against The Dark Arts I decided to use this.

For The Goblet of Fire I decided to take the words for what they were so I put a silhouette version of the goblet of fire itself onto the cover.  This was an important part of the movie as it was The Goblet of Fire which chose the champions for The Triwizard Tournament that had been tampered with by Barty Crouch Jr.

I didn't like the lack of consistency within these covers.  I felt as though The Prisoner of Azkaban cover didn't match as it wasn't a black silhouette and I didn't like it so I decided to choose another book.   The Deathly Hallows was easy for me to design.  I simply used the Deathly Hallows symbol.  The Deathly Hallows symbol represents the three items that represent the gift each character within The Tale of The Three Brothers.  These are the Elder Wand, The Invisibility Cloak and the Ressurection Stone.

My final idea was for some classic plays.  I chose A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen, The Crucible by Arthur Miller and eventually I chose The Catcher in The Rye by J.D Salinger even though it wasn't a play but I still counted it as a classic.  


For A Doll's house I decided to use the title and create a sketch-like image of a doll's house.  The play features a woman called Nora whose life is shown through the deterioration of her marriage in what appears to be a male society.  Through the book she is depicted almost as a doll that her husband plays with for his amusement.  Her life seems perfect but in reality it's not.

The Crucible is about the 15th Century Witch Trials in Salem.  For this reason I chose a noose.  Nooses place a large part within the play as this is the method of capital punishment for suspected witches.  Through the book many young women were killed by this method or face charges punishable by hanging.  Once again I created a sketch-like image to keep the consistency within the three book covers.

The Catcher in the Rye is about a young boy who runs away from his boarding school and finds his place in New York where he meets drugs, alcohol and woman.  Almost all of the book is based in New York so for this reason I depicted the Empire State building using the same style as the other two images.

Once I had created these book covers I knew these would be my final choices for books however I needed to create some variations in order to see what I would like best.

I decided I prefer the author's names at the bottom as they looked too cramped together at the top with the titles.  I put these in the middle of the cover in order to keep the centered theme down the page.

I then decided to put these on some covers and tested them on Amazon pages to see what they would look like.
