# BookCovers

On beginning this task the first thing I did was look through the books I had at home to get an idea of what type of books I would be interested in designing.  The first book I saw that I was interested in was called 'Missing Judy' by Anne Cassidy. I'd read this book a few times and I enjoyed the story.  The story involved a child who had been missing for 8 years when new leads begin to show and so the case is reopened.  I researched the book to find any book covers created for the book.
