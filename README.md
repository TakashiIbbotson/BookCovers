# BookCovers

On beginning this task the first thing I did was look through the books I had at home to get an idea of what type of books I would be interested in designing.  The first book I saw that I was interested in was called 'Missing Judy' by Anne Cassidy. I'd read this book a few times and I enjoyed the story.  The story involved a child who had been missing for 8 years when new leads begin to show and so the case is reopened.  I researched the book to find any book covers created for the book.

I began to think about the main points in the book and the most memorable part for me was the memory the protagonist has of the last memory of his sister with a red balloon.  I'd already seen that this was on some of the book covers however I wanted to create my own take on it.  I created a silhoutte image of a young child and added a balloon into the image of which I changed the layer style in order to give it a translucent look.  This semi-realism juxtaposed with the harsh black silhouette.

After creating this book cover I realised I couldn't think of any books of the same genre or the same author so after I created this I began to think of other books I liked.  As one of my favourite series of books is Harry Potter I decided to select a few of the books to design for.  I decided to keep the flat silhouette style design that I had used for Missing Judy.  I began to research the Harry Potter books to see the covers.

I began to think of which books I would choose and in the end I decided on The Philosopher's Stone, The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Deathly Hallows.  I wasn't sure what I would put on each cover.  For The Philsopher's Stone I decided to use a chess piece.  Wizard's Chess plays a large part within the books.  Not only is Harry introduced to it within the book and plays it throughout his school year with Ron Weasley
